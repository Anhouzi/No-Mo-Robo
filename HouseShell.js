   Note: in this section is my guess as to what functions or variables this class may need functions in
   caps are things I think we will need but haven't discussed in detail
   
   var noHealth-true if house has no health in which case we end the game
   
   function COLLISIONCHECK- check to see if the house has been hit
   function UPDATE-standard update method so we can provide feedback to the player
